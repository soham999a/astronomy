      question: "What is the difference between Vedic and Western numerology?",

    },
    {
      question: "How can changing my name actually impact my life?",
      answer: "Names carry vibrations that interact with your birth energy. When they're harmonized, this creates a positive resonance that can remove obstacles and open new opportunities. We've documented numerous cases where name corrections have led to significant positive life changes."
    },
    {
      question: "Is online consultation as effective as in-person?",
      answer: "Absolutely. The calculations and analysis are identical whether done in person or remotely. We've successfully conducted thousands of online consultations with equal effectiveness to in-person sessions."
    },
    {
      question: "How long does it take to see results after numerological changes?",
      answer: "Most clients report noticing subtle changes within 1-3 months, with more significant shifts occurring over 6-12 months. However, this varies depending on individual circumstances and the specific changes implemented."
